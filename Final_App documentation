Week 4 Progress Report
completed:

Developed a fully functional Streamlit app that integrates my AI ensemble regression model to predict AC power from solar energy data.

Implemented anomaly detection on the predicted AC power using Isolation Forest.

Built an interactive UI with sections for file upload, dynamic plotting of actual vs predicted AC power, anomaly markers, and a clear weekly summary.

Enabled downloading a CSV file of detected anomalies for easy integration with Zapier alerts.

Set up ngrok tunneling to share the Streamlit app publicly from the Colab environment for easy demo access.

What features didn’t work or weren’t completed:

The app currently uses a local model file saved within the session, so the model retrains from scratch if the Colab session restarts. Persistent model storage or external hosting is not yet implemented.

I did not integrate a real GPT-powered summary due to API access limitations; the summary is a simple anomaly count.

Zapier automation workflow is not directly integrated inside the app — users must manually upload the anomaly CSV to their Zapier triggers.

What I plan to complete in Week 5:

Implement persistent model saving/loading via cloud storage or database to avoid retraining every session.

Add real AI-generated textual summaries using OpenAI GPT or another language model API to provide richer insights.

Build automated alert triggers using Zapier integration to send Slack or email notifications on anomaly detection.

Enhance UI polish, including better layout responsiveness, file validation feedback, and tooltip explanations for anomalies.

How to run and use the app demo:
After running the Colab cells, you will see a Streamlit app public URL printed by ngrok, e.g.:
Streamlit app URL: http://xxxxxx.ngrok-free.app

Click the public URL link to open the dashboard in a new browser tab.

Use the file uploader on the left side to upload a CSV file with columns:
['date', 'hour', 'dc_power', 'daily_yield', 'total_yield', 'ac_power']
(You can use the sample CSV file I provided or your own data.)

The app will:

Train the model if not already trained, or load the saved model.

Predict AC power values for your data.

Detect anomalies in the predictions and mark them on the graph in red.

Show a weekly summary of anomaly counts.

List detailed anomaly alerts below the summary.

Provide a button to download the anomalies CSV for use in external alerting tools like Zapier.

Refresh or upload new CSV files anytime to update the charts and results.
