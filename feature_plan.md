# Feature Engineering Plan

Below are the planned features to enhance AI/ML model performance:

1. **7-day Rolling Average**  
   Smooths out short-term fluctuations to reveal trends and seasonality.

2. **Hourly Percentage Change**  
   Captures sudden increases or drops in energy output for anomaly detection.

3. **Time Since Last Peak**  
   Measures duration since last maximum output, useful for cycle analysis.

4. **Daily Total Energy Produced**  
   Summarizes overall daily performance for trend analysis.

5. **Day of Week Indicator**  
   Models potential weekly patterns in energy production.
