1. **User uploads raw data CSV** via interface or triggers pipeline.  
2. **Pipeline runs data cleaning and feature engineering** automatically.  
3. **Forecasting model executes** using prepared features.  
4. **GPT-based summary generates** a natural language report of daily output and anomalies.  
5. **Results and alerts** are delivered via email or displayed on a dashboard.  
6. **Human operators review flagged anomalies and reports**, taking action if needed.

**Trigger:** Manual upload or scheduled daily run.  
**Alerts:** Generated if anomalies exceed thresholds.  
**User Interaction:** Upload data, view summary, respond to alerts.
