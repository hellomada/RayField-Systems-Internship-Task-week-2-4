Completed:

Streamlit App Functionality:

Ensemble regression model for AC power prediction using:

Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost combined via VotingRegressor

Isolation Forest for anomaly detection with adjustable contamination levels

Interactive chart showing actual vs predicted AC power, highlighting anomalies in red

Demo Mode:

Embedded sample CSV data for testing without uploading

Allows immediate visualization and GPT summary generation

GPT Summary Integration:

Uses OpenAI API (new client interface) for actionable energy insights

Summaries provide anomalies, patterns, and recommended actions

Optional: Adjust API key easily via OPENAI_API_KEY variable or environment variable

UI Improvements:

Two-column layout: Chart + Summary/Anomalies

Download button for anomaly CSV for Zapier or further automation

Slider to adjust anomaly detection sensitivity

Expanders for file upload/training sections

Error messages displayed cleanly via st.error

Failsafes & Robustness:

CSV format validation and missing column detection

Date parsing validation

Model training and loading error handling

Prediction, anomaly detection, chart rendering safe-guards

Ngrok Integration:

Allows live sharing of Streamlit app

Automatic setup and teardown included

Not Completed / Future Work:

Persistent cloud-hosted model storage for multi-user access

Direct Zapier/automation workflow integration

More advanced GPT summaries:

Multi-step actionable insights

Trend predictions

Recommendations with priorities

Enhanced UI elements:

Hover tooltips over chart points

Zoomable / pan-able charts

Interactive anomaly selection

Multi-file upload and batch predictions

Lessons Learned:

Validating CSV formats in advance prevents runtime errors

Demo mode is critical for smooth testing and presentations

GPT summaries can quickly provide actionable insights for non-technical users

Clear separation of workflow stages (upload → model → prediction → anomaly → summary → alert) simplifies debugging and maintenance

Handling API key securely and clearly is essential for collaboration
