# Handoff Notes - Week 5 (Updated)

## Completed:
- Streamlit app with ensemble regression model for AC power prediction
- Anomaly detection with Isolation Forest
- Interactive chart with actual vs predicted power and anomaly markers
- Demo mode ready (can use embedded CSV or uploaded CSV)
- GPT summary integration using OpenAI API for simple weekly insights
- UI improvements:
  - Two-column layout (chart + summary/alerts)
  - Download button for anomaly CSV
  - Slider to adjust anomaly detection sensitivity
  - Expanders for file upload/training sections
- Failsafes for CSV reading, date parsing, model training, prediction, anomaly detection, chart rendering
- Ngrok tunneling for live sharing

## Not Completed / Future Work:
- Persistent cloud-hosted model storage
- Direct Zapier automation integration
- More advanced GPT summaries with actionable recommendations
- Additional interactive UI elements (hover tooltips, zoomable charts)

## Lessons Learned:
- Pre-testing CSV formats prevents runtime crashes
- Embedding demo data ensures smooth presentation without external dependencies
- Simple GPT integration can provide understandable insights quickly for non-technical users
- Separation of workflow (upload → model → prediction → anomaly → summary → alert) makes debugging easier
