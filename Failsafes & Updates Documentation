Failsafes & Updates Documentation

Here’s your update log for the improved code:

Project: Energy AI Dashboard with AI Model & Anomaly Detection
Version: 1.1 Failsafe & Enhancement Edition
Author: (You)
Date: 2025-08-14

Failsafes Added

Safe CSV Loading

Wrapped pd.read_csv() in try/except with clear error messages.

Prevents app crash on bad files or wrong formats.

Column Validation

Checks for exact required columns before continuing.

Displays error if missing.

Safe Date Parsing

Date parsing in try/except so bad formats don’t stop the app.

Feature Engineering Guard

Returns None and stops execution if required feature columns missing.

Model Training Guard

If training fails, shows error instead of crashing.

Model Loading Guard

Handles corrupted or missing model files gracefully.

Prediction Guard

Catches errors if predict() fails (e.g., shape mismatch).

Anomaly Detection Guard

Handles failures in IsolationForest fitting and prediction.

Chart Rendering Guard

Prevents chart code from stopping the app if Matplotlib errors occur.

Anomaly Reporting Guard

Handles missing or invalid anomaly data when generating alert list or CSV.

Ngrok Tunnel Guard

If tunnel fails to start, informs user and still lets app run locally.

Streamlit Launch Guard

If streamlit run fails, prints error instead of silently dying.

Enhancements Added

Clear Error Messages in UI

All failsafes report exactly what failed and why.

No Logic Changes

Original functionality preserved; only reliability improved.

Future Upgrade Hooks

Code structured so demo mode, sliders, caching, and sampling can be added easily.
